I am a Ph.D. student in the Institute of Software Research at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am co-advised by [Cleotilde Gonzalez](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/cotyweb/) and [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/). My current projects involve designing multi-agent models of cooperation for defense in cybersecurity contexts.
